This thesis investigates dance as an instrument for signaling,
which is a kind of sub-conscious nonverbal communication, in
the context of nuptial rituals. Specifically, this study
examines the functions of dance within these rituals. At the
same time, it contributes to the evolutionary discussion about
why behavior like dance emerged and what its role is in
contemporary humans. Increased attention is paid to
cross-cultural databases that are the source of material for
this work, as their development and proper use are the
subjects of an ongoing scientific discussion.
